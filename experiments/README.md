# privateExperiments

This workspace is used for notes and experiments during my studies at the University of Stuttgart, where I am pursuing a B.Sc. in Software Engineering.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document my progress throughout my studies. At the beginning, the code quality might not be optimal as I am still learning, but I aim to show my continuous improvement. Over time, the quality of code, documentation, and structure will reflect my growth as a software engineer.
